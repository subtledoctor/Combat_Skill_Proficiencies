@1219   = ~THIEF: To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the Thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are the Thief's hallmarks. Whether to turn such talents against innocent passersby and wealthy merchants, or oppressors and monsters, is a choice for the Thief to make.

While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

To do so, wizards study strange tongues and obscure facts and devote much time to magical research. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms.

The Mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells; This breadth of focus makes Mages well suited to the demands of adventuring.

CLASS FEATURES:
- May not wear any armor.
- May not advance past Proficiency (+) in any weapon class.
- May not place any slots in any fighting style.
- May cast arcane spells.
- Hit Die: d4

4 stars: +4 to hit, +4 damage, +1.5 APR~

3 stars: +3 to hit, +2 damage, +1 APR
4 stars: +4 to hit, +4 damage, +1.5 APR~

3 stars: +3 to hit, +2 damage, +1 APR
4 stars: +4 to hit, +4 damage, +1.5 APR~
@1244   = ~SLING: Although the sling is commonly thought of as a toy weapon, its lethality should not be underestimated. A strong bullet thrown from a sling by an experienced user can tear a hole through a man's skull.

2 stars: +1 to hit, +1 damage, +.5 APR
3 stars: +3 to hit, +2 damage, +1 APR
4 stars: +4 to hit, +4 damage, +1.5 APR~
@1245   = ~TWO-HAND STYLE: Investing in this fighting style allows the character to make the best use of two-handed melee weapons, handling them more deftly and inflicting more grievous blows.

Proficient (+): The wielder gets a +1 bonus to thac0 and damage rolls, a -1 bonus to weapon speed factor, and critical hits occur on a roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20).

~
@1246   = ~SHIELD-FIGHTING: Investing in this fighting style, a character maximizes the protection afforded by a shield and overcomes the difficulty coordinating the use of both weapon and shield.

Specialized (++): Once per round, the wielder can perform a Shield Bash, doing 1d3 nonlethal damage and knocking the nearest attacker of his or or feet on a failed save vs. Breath Weapon.

Specialized (++): The wielder's base attack rate is increased by 1 attack per 2 rounds.
~
@1248   = ~proficiencies~
@1249   = ~DUAL-WIELDING: This fighting style involves using a second melee weapon (generally a very small one) alongside the wielder's main weapon. It is difficult to coordinate, especially with larger weapons; attacks tend to suffer from decreased accuracy; however, if the wielder is skilled the 2nd weapon can be useful in both an offensive and defensive manner.

Proficient (+): Equipping a small weapon in the off-hand will provide a -2 bonus to AC against melee attacks.

Specialized (++): A weapon equipped in the off-hand may be used to make one attack per round, at the same thac0 as the wielder's main weapon.

(FOR CLARIFICATION: off-hand weapons will suffer a major penalty to attack unless you are specialized in this style.)

Coordinating the use of two weapons is difficult, especially with larger, heavier weapons.  When dual-wielding, all melee attacks wil suffer a 1-point thac0 penalty for each medium-sized weapon equipped, and a 2-point penalty for each large weapon.
- Small weapons: dagger, short sword, ninja-to.
- Medium weapons: wakizashi, club, war hammmer, mace, morning star.

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Wisdom, Charisma
~
@12236  = ~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, <PRO_HESHE> studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of <PRO_HISHER> time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The Mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells; <PRO_HISHER> broad range makes <PRO_HIMHER> well suited to the demands of adventuring.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May not wear any armor.
- May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
- Begins with three proficiency points at first level, and does not gain any more after that.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May cast arcane spells.
- Hit Die: d4

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Intelligence
~
@12237  = ~THIEF: To accomplish <PRO_HISHER> goals, for good or ill, the Thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are <PRO_HISHER> hallmarks. Whether <PRO_HESHE> turns <PRO_HISHER> talent against innocent passersby and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for the Thief to make.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.
- May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
- May only use the following weapons: long sword, short sword, katana, scimitar, dagger, club, quarterstaff, crossbow, shortbow, dart, sling.
- Begins with six proficiency points at first level, and gains another point every second level.
- One point may be invested in a proficiency at level 1; two points at level 2; three points at level 5, and four or more points at level 9.
- May become Specialized (two points) with appropriate weapons and fighting styles, and with the Attack Speed, Dodge, Ranged Accuracy, and Thrown Weapons skills.
- May learn a few select tactical combat postures and physical fitness feats, as well as various miscellaneous skills and even some magical abilities and illusion spells.
- May distribute 25 points per level (40 at level 1) in thieving abilities: Open Locks, Pick Pockets, Find Traps, Move Silently, Hide In Shadows, Detect Illusion, Set Traps.
- Starts with base scores of 10% in Open Locks, 5% in Find Traps, 15% in Pick Pockets, 10% in Move Silently, and 5% in Hide in Shadows.
- May achieve Grand Mastery (four points) in the Backstabbing skill, resulting in backstabs that do two, three, four or five times the damage of a normal weapon strike.

SET SNARE: Set a trap in the chosen location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps grow more powerful with the Thief's level and can only be triggered by enemies.
  1st level: Deals 2d8+5 missile damage.
  11th level: Deals 2d8+5 missile damage and additionally deals 2d6 poison damage per round for the next 3 rounds.

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Dexterity
~
@12238  = ~BARD: The Bard is a rogue, but <PRO_HESHE> is very different from the Thief. The Bard's strength is <PRO_HISHER> pleasant and charming personality. With it and <PRO_HISHER> wits, <PRO_HESHE> makes <PRO_HISHER> way through the world. A Bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore; <PRO_HESHE> learns a little bit about everything that crosses <PRO_HISHER> path and is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May not wear armor heavier than chain mail. (Spells cannot be cast while wearing armor.)
- May not equip shields larger than bucklers.

~
@12239  = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May not wear any armor.
- May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
- Begins with three proficiency points at first level, and does not gain any more after that.
- May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
- May cast arcane spells.
- May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
- Hit Die: d4
~
@12240  = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May not wear any armor.
- May only use weapons available to the Thief class (except two-handed).
- Begins with five proficiency points at first level, and gains another point every third level.

  Level 3-5: 1d8
  Level 6-8: 1d10
  Level 9-14: 1d12
  Level 15+: 1d20
- At level 9, unarmed attacks are treated as a +1 magical weapon and gain a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls. This enchantment improves to +2 at level 12, +3 at level 15, and +4 at level 25. 
- Receives a +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Spell.
- Deflect Missiles: +1 bonus to AC vs. missile attacks every 3 levels.

- 14th level: Gains 3% Magic Resistance per level (starting with 42% at 14th level).
- 20th level: Becomes immune to non-magical weapons.
- Alignment restricted to lawful.
- Hit Die: d8
~
@12241  = ~SHAMAN: Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
- May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
- May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.

- One point may be invested in a proficiency at level 1; two points at level 5; and three or more points at level 9.

- May learn a few select miscellaneous skills.

- Gains immediate access to a number of Shaman-specific spells, which can be cast like any other: Spirit Ward, Writhing Fog, Spiritual Clarity, Spirit Fire, Recall Spirit, Spiritual Lock, and Ether Gate.
- Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 100% at level 20.
- May use Shamanic Dance at will.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 35% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 75% at level 20. Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.

NOTE: this should be used right away (or not at all). If the character levels up and advances a proficiency, it will prevent this tome from granting the correct number of proficiency points.

If you also have a tome enabling you to change your class and kit, you should decide whether you want to use that tome or this one. Each will make the other one disappear.
